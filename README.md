# Bad-Apple-ASCII

This project transforms the famous "Bad Apple" music video into ASCII video art using OpenCV and displays it in a separate window using Pygame.

## Features
- Converts video frames to ASCII characters
- Displays ASCII video using Pygame

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- OpenCV
- Pygame
- Numpy

You can install these libraries using pip:
_pip install opencv-python pygame numpy_

## How It Works
1. Video Processing: The script uses OpenCV to read each frame of the "Bad Apple" video.
2. Frame Conversion: Each frame is converted to grayscale and then mapped to ASCII characters based on pixel intensity.
3. Display: The ASCII art frames are displayed in a Pygame window, creating an animation

## Materials
The materials and inspiration for this project were taken from an article on [Habr](https://habr.com/ru/articles/790524/), and the "Bad Apple" video and music were used as the source content.
